Refactor application from PyQt GUI to web-based architecture

This commit transforms the application from a PyQt desktop app to a web-based 
application with a CGI backend and CLI curl interface, as specified in the updated 
README. Major changes include:

### Configuration:
- Updated config/vnc_config.json to include sites configuration
- Removed external dependencies from requirements.txt

### Core Architecture:
- Switched from PyQt GUI to web-based interface
- Removed LSF Python API dependencies, now using CLI commands
- Created a CGI web server for handling requests

### Web Components:
- Created myvnc/web/server.py - CGI HTTP server
- Added myvnc/web/static/index.html - Core HTML UI
- Added myvnc/web/static/css/styles.css - Styling
- Added myvnc/web/static/js/app.js - Frontend JavaScript

### CLI Components:
- Created myvnc/cli/cli.py - Command-line interface using curl
- Added command-line functionality matching web capabilities
- Implemented server management capabilities

### Utilities:
- Updated myvnc/utils/config_manager.py with improved configuration handling
- Updated myvnc/utils/lsf_manager.py to use command line instead of API
- Added documentation and error handling

### Entry Points:
- Added main.py as simple web server launcher
- Updated setup.py to reflect new entry points and dependencies

This refactoring aligns with the updated requirements to use minimal dependencies
and command-line interactions with LSF rather than APIs. All functionality 
remains intact with both web and CLI interfaces providing the same capabilities.
